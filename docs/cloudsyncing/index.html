<h1>Cloud Syncing with Codex</h1>
<br>
<p>You can choose to sync your notes between multiple computers with a service like iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. very easily.</p>
<p>You must have the cloud software installed on your computer and preferrably have a synced drive folder that you use.</p>
<br><br>
<b>To sync your notes, first do this on the computer that currently has your notes:</b>
<ol style="line-height: 36px;">
    <li>Create an empty folder (named something like Codex to remember where it is) in the synced drive.</li>
    <li>Go to the Settings tab on the left and find the "Change save directory" setting.</li>
    <li>Click the "folder" button on the right side to select the folder you created in the synced drive.</li>
    <li>Codex will restart, and there should be no notebooks in the Notebooks section in the side menu.</li>
    <li>If you hover over the "Revert to default save directory" button it will tell you where your notes are stored.</li>
    <li>Navigate to that location on your computer, and copy the <code>save.json</code> file and the <code>notes</code> folder.</li>
    <li>Paste those into the new Codex folder you created in the synced drive.</li>
    <li>Restart Codex, and your notebooks and notes should appear in the side menu.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>Next, do this on any other computer where you want to have your notes available:</b>
<ol style="line-height: 36px;">
    <li>Make sure that same cloud software is installed and synced.</li>
    <li>Go to the Settings tab and change the Save Directory to that synced Codex folder.</li>
    <li>Codex will restart, and all your notes should appear in the side menu.</li>
</ol>
